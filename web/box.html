    <h1>CSS Box Theory</h1>
    <p>The CSS Box theory is the theory of which all sizes and positions of an element rely on. Refer to the image below. </p>
    <img src="box.png" alt="Image of a CSS box">
    <p>As you can see from the above image, elements have different layers. The outermost layer is the margin, which is not counted within the element, but which size is determined from properties of the element. The border is the boundary of what is in the element and what is not. Inside is the padding, which is the space between the content and the border, and finally the content is in the center of the box. All measurements referring to the element are calculated from the border. </p>
